## Introduction

You may belong to a group of people who left Laravel a few years ago and would like a quick summary of everything that changed now that you are coming back.

Well, this is your lucky day. Instead of letting you pour hours into reading every upgrade guide, I leveraged the power of AI to compile a (non-exhaustive) list that will give you a great overview.

## Changes in the directory structure

### Moved directories

1. In Laravel 9, the *resources/lang* directory has been moved to the root project directory.

### New directories

1. *factories*: in Laravel 8, model factories were rewritten to support classes, and they are stored in the `database/factories` directory.
2. *seeders*: still in Laravel 8 , seeder classes are now stored in the `database/seeders` directory.

## Removed or changed functionalities

1. Authentication scaffolding moved to [laravel/ui](https://github.com/laravel/ui) repository.
2. The `str_` and `array_` helpers were removed from the framework in Laravel 6.0 and moved to the [laravel/helpers package](https://github.com/laravel/helpers).
