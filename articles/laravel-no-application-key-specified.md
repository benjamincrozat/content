## Introduction

*"No application encryption key has been specified."* is quite common in Laravel, and it means exactly what it says: *there's no encryption key specified for your application.*

**To fix _"No application encryption key has been specified."_, run the command `php artisan key:generate`.**

## How to fix "No application encryption key has been specified."

Laravel uses an encryption key to secure sessions, cookies, serialized data, password hashes, and other encrypted data.

If this key is not set, Laravel cannot guarantee the security of these things, hence the error message.

This is a big problem, especially in production where sensitive data must be encrypted. Here's how to fix the issue:

1. **Generate an application key:** Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the command `php artisan key:generate`. This command will generate a new random key for your application. Just to be safe, run `php artisan config:clear` just in case you previously cached the config values.
2. **Create the eventually missing *.env* file:** The above command sets the generated key to your `APP_KEY` environment variable in your *.env* file. Laravel should automatically have created it based on *.env.example* at the root of your project. If you get the `file_get_contents(/path/to/project/.env): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory` error message, it means it didn't. You must create it yourself by running `cp .env.example .env` for instance.

Remember, it's important to keep your `APP_KEY` secret and not to commit your *.env* file to version control systems.

## Bonus: fix the issue with one click

So much that Laravel offers you to fix it with just a single click!
