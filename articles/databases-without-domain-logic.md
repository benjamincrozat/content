In this article, Alex Kondov shares why it's crucial not to store domain logic in databases while still utilizing them to their full extent.

He bases his argument on maintainability difficulties and threats to the separation of concerns, emphasizing the downside of splitting logic between the application and its storage. He also gives practical examples of improving the utilization of database capabilities without adding domain logic. One such case involves handling user reactions to data using application-level functionality rather than database triggers.

Kondov's central point revolves around the importance of using databases as holders of information instead of decision-making tools.
