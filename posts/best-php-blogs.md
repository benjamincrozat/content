## Introduction

I wouldn’t be where I am today without other developers sharing their knowledge for free through blogging.

Therefore, I present you a bunch of awesome PHP blogs from community members publishing interesting and valuable content. Get your RSS feeds aggregator and follow me!

(I will update this article each time I find a new PHP blog worth reading.)

![Laravel Daily](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/82/conversions/laraveldaily.com__s5v4he-medium.jpg)

Laravel Daily, written by Povilas Korop, is more than a blog.

Its content would take more than a life time to consume and there's even more than that like free and premium videos, a newsletter, a jobs board, etc. 

A must read for any Laravel developer. 🔥

### [Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com)

[![Laravel News](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/83/conversions/CleanShot_2023-08-17_at_16.41.11_2x_fmrchb-medium.jpg)](https://laravel-news.com)

Laravel News is one publication I read a lot. It was created back in 2012 by Eric Barnes and is the official source of news about the framework's ecosystem. They also have a [podcast](https://laravel-news.com/podcast) and a [newsletter](https://laravel-news.com/newsletter).

If Laravel is your cup of tea, this is a must-read.

Tim is a core Laravel team member. At the time I'm writing these lines, he is trying to redesign PHP's official website. His blog is interesting and should teach a thing or two even to the best of us.
