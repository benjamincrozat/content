Tim MacDonald sheds new light on a commonly held belief in web development circles -- that fast database queries are always good, and slow queries bad. MacDonald, an experienced developer, admitted to contributing to this confusion by failing to clearly explain a certain Laravel method.

In an interesting spin, he suggests that fast queries could actually slow down HTTP requests if they're happening in mass in a single interaction. He then goes on to demonstrate a feature in Laravel that neatly tracks such cumulative query time, thus helping optimize resource usage.
