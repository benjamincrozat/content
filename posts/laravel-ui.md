## Introduction to the Laravel UI package

When working on a web project destined to get some users, having a user-friendly interface is necessary.

That's where [Laravel UI](https://github.com/laravel/ui) comes into play. It offers a basic yet effective starting point for incorporating some CSS and a JavaScript framework into your Laravel projects. It even supports scaffolding pages related to the authentication of your users.

Now, before you continue, **please note that while Laravel UI is still maintained, it's also an old package that have better alternatives such as [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com) and [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits#laravel-breeze)**. For instance, Laravel UI does not support as many authentication features as these two.

But I noticed that people are still looking for it, so I told myself that I should write a small article about it anyway!

## Installing Laravel UI

Getting started with Laravel UI is straightforward. Install it via the following command:

```bash
composer require laravel/ui
```

Next, you can install the frontend scaffolding of your choice. **Remember, the next command won't add any component to your app. It will just make your app ready for whatever front-end framework you want to use.** The Laravel UI package supports [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) without JavaScript or Bootstrap combined with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) or [React](https://react.dev):

```bash
php artisan ui bootstrap
php artisan ui vue
php artisan ui react
```

Finally, install and compile your front-end dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Installing Laravel UI with authentication features

Installing the authentication part of Laravel UI is completely optional. If you want to use it, you can install it using the `--auth` flag:

```bash
php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
php artisan ui vue --auth
php artisan ui react --auth
```

Now, you have a basic user interface for user registration and authentication and you can customize it to your liking.

Before refreshing your browser, make sure to install and compile your front-end dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You now have everything you need to move forward on your project.

## Customizing the CSS and JavaScript Laravel UI provides

After installing Laravel UI, you can dive into customizing the CSS and JavaScript.

Laravel uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) out-of-the-box for handling these aspects.

If you are still using a CSS preprocessor like Sass, or Less, Vite streamlines the process and you can [learn more about it on the official documentation of Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/vite).

For JavaScript, Laravel allows flexibility. You can use Vue.js, React, or anything else and even go without JavaScript.

The setup with Laravel UI just makes it easier to integrate these technologies seamlessly into your project.

Here's what the Vite configuration file looks like when using Vue.js:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: [
                'resources/sass/app.scss',
                'resources/js/app.js',
            ],
            refresh: true,
            detectTls: true,
        }),
        vue({
            template: {
                transformAssetUrls: {
                    base: null,
                    includeAbsolute: false,
                },
            },
        }),
    ],
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            vue: 'vue/dist/vue.esm-bundler.js',
        },
    },
});
```
