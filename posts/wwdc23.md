## Introduction

**WWDC stands for "Worldwide Developers Conference".** Think of it as a huge gathering, hosted by Apple each year. It's a bit like a big party for anyone who creates stuff for their devices.

But it's not just about native apps. Apple also talks about Safari and web technologies during WWDC.

This year, it's a bit special, though. They're also showing how to create great experiences with web technologies on their Apple Vision Pro headset.

First, I suggest taking a look at the super exhaustive [release notes for Safari](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes).

## What's new in web apps

1. **Web apps on Mac are now available**, allowing users to have dedicated and focused experiences with their frequently used websites.
2. Adding websites as web apps is done by adding them to the Dock on macOS.
3. **Web apps on Mac have a default behavior that works well for most websites**, but **developers can customize their app's behavior** using a web app manifest.
4. **Web app scope can be adjusted to control how links within the app open**, either within the web app or in the default browser.
5. **Authentication state should be saved in cookies** to ensure smooth user experiences when logging into web apps.
6. **Web apps on Mac and iOS support notifications**, including sounds, badging, and integration with Focus modes. (Learn more about the [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API).)
7. **The web app manifest’s "id" key allows for syncing Focus modes** and management of distinct web apps under the same domain.
8. **New APIs are available in WebKit**, including the **[User Activation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UserActivation)**, **updated [Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API)**, and **preliminary support for the [Screen Orientation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen/orientation)**.

## Meet Safari for spatial computing

1. **Safari for spatial computing uses the same WebKit engine** and supports web standards, enabling a seamless browsing experience.
2. **The platform supports direct and indirect gestures**, allowing users to interact with websites using eye and hand gestures.
3. Interactive regions in Safari indicate interactivity and are generated automatically by WebKit based on accessible markup and CSS styling.
4. **Full-screen windows on Safari can be resized on visionOS and may sometimes be larger than the reported screen dimensions.**
5. Performance optimizations matter in animations and scrolling, so **using [passive scroll event listeners](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/uses-passive-event-listeners/) and [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) is recommended**.
6. **Integrating 3D content** like AR Quick Look or HTML model element with USDZ files **can enhance a user's browsing experience**.
7. **The W3C standard [WebXR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API) provides immersive scenes on the web using WebGL**, enabling developers to experiment with immersive web experiences.

## What's new in CSS

- **[:user-valid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-valid) and [:user-invalid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-invalid) pseudo-classes:** These classes help manage the validation of form inputs in a more intuitive way than previously possible. They allow styling based on whether the user has filled out a form field correctly or not.
- **Enhancements to the [:has() pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has):** The power of :has() has been increased to work with even more pseudo-classes, allowing more versatile styling depending on the presence of specific elements or states. For instance, you can now style elements based on the presence of a particular language with :has(:lang()).
- **The [:dir](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:dir) pseudo-class:** This class is crucial for supporting different text flow directions based on the language being used, often abbreviated as LTR and RTL.
- **New line-height units:** The [lh](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/length#lh) and [rlh](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/length#rlh) units in CSS are new additions that allow designers to create a more cohesive and rhythmically consistent layout by relating elements to the line-height of the typography.
- **[font-size-adjust](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust):** This CSS property adjusts the visual size of a font, allowing for greater visual consistency across different font styles and sizes.
- **[text-box-trim](https://css-tricks.com/leading-trim-the-future-of-digital-typesetting/):** This property allows for trimming of extra space in a text box, helping to resolve common alignment issues in web typography.
- **[Counter styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style):** CSS now allows you to define custom numbering systems and styles for HTML lists.
- **Further support for [Open Type features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/OpenType_fonts_guide), [Media Queries range syntax](https://css-tricks.com/the-new-css-media-query-range-syntax/), [boolean logic](https://css-tricks.com/logical-operations-with-css-variables/), [@property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@property), [CSS Nesting](https://webkit.org/blog/13813/try-css-nesting-today-in-safari-technology-preview/), and much more.**

## What's new in Web Inspector

1. **Typography Inspection tools**: The Font panel in Web Inspector allows developers to inspect the properties and capabilities of the font used on a selected element, as well as supported font feature properties and their values. This panel now shows warnings for synthetic bold or oblique styles and provides a list of supported variation axes for variable fonts.

2. **Emulating User Preferences**: The new User Preference Overrides popover in the Elements tab enables developers to override user preferences just for the inspected page while Web Inspector is open. Preferences like color scheme, reduced motion, and increased contrast can be emulated easily using this tool.

3. **New Element badges**: The node tree view in the Elements tab now shows badges next to elements that act as CSS Flex or CSS Grid containers, as well as badges next to scroll containers to help identify unwanted scroll. 

4. **Breakpoints enhancements**: Breakpoints can be configured with various properties to control when they are hit and even run actions when they do. This includes setting conditions, ignoring the breakpoint for a specific number of times, and running actions like evaluating a JavaScript expression or logging messages to the console without pausing.
