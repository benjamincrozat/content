Are you building your App on Laravel? That's a great choiceüéâ. You must be planning an **Admin panel** for it. Well, if you're building one, let me give an overview of how you can make a customizable & functional Admin panel with **less effort**.

Admin Panels are made of [CRUDs](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/6.x/getting-started-basics#whats-a-crud), [Charts](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/6.x/base-widgets#chart-pro), and [Widgets](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/6.x/base-widgets). The major component is the CRUD, which is built with various fields and columns. I'm writing this article about a package that will help you generate **Laravel CRUDs** in just 5 minutes.

# Installation.

We'll be using [https://backpackforlaravel.com](https://backpackforlaravel.com) to generate Laravel CRUDs. You can experience a Monster CRUD in the [live demo](https://demo.backpackforlaravel.com/admin/monster) and be more confident in giving it a shot. So, are you ready?

Let's install it now:

1. Go to your Laravel project's directory, then in your terminal, run:


```shell
composer require backpack/crud
```

2. Follow the prompts - in the end, the installer will also tell you your admin panel's URL, where you should go and login.


```shell
php artisan backpack:install
```

> Note: Make sure the `APP_URL` in your .env file is correctly pointing to the URL you use to access your application in the browser, for example: `http:127.0.0.1:8000` or [`http://something.test`](http://something.test)

If you are facing trouble, check the [installation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/6.x/installation) page for help!

## Laravel CRUD with a single command

To generate Laravel CRUD, we need a table.

1. Let's assume we have the `tags` table. You can copy the following migration to make one.


```php
Schema::create('tags', function (Blueprint $table) {
  $table->increments('id');
  $table->string('name');
  $table->string('slug')->unique();
  $table->timestamps();
});
```

2. Now, We'll run the following command to generate CRUD:


```bash
php artisan backpack:crud tag # use singular, not plural (like the Model name)
```

The code above will generate the following:

* a model (`app/Models/Tag.php`);
* a controller (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/TagCrudController.php`);
* a request (`app/Http/Requests/TagCrudRequest.php`);
* a resource route, as a line inside `routes/backpack/custom.php`;
* a new menu item in `resources/views/vendor/backpack/ui/inc/menu_items.blade.php`;

Done! Go to https://localhost/admin/tag to see your Laravel CRUD in action.

## CRUD Customization

We'll go through the generated files and customize them per project needs. Majorly customization includes:

* **Field** types for Create & Update Form.
* **Columns** types for List & Show.


Let's look at the generated Controller `TagCrudController.php` and add Fields & Columns:

```diff
<?php
...
use Backpack\CRUD\app\Library\CrudPanel\CrudPanelFacade as CRUD;

class TagCrudController extends CrudController
{
    ...
    protected function setupListOperation()
    {
+       CRUD::column('name')->type(text);
+       CRUD::column('slug')->type(text);
    }

    protected function setupCreateOperation()
    {
        CRUD::setValidation(TagRequest::class);
+       CRUD::field('name')->type(text);
+       CRUD::field('slug')->type(text);
    }
    ...
}
```

This less gets you a fully working CRUD:
