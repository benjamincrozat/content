## Introduction

**To clear the cache in Laravel, run `php artisan optimize:clear`.** This works no matter which cache driver you are using. It will also clear the bootstrap files (events, compiled, config, routes, and views).

Now that we got this out of the way, let me remind you that Laravel has many kinds of caches. The framework offers a command for every variety of cache that you can use to enjoy a more granular level of control.

## Clear all caches in Laravel

As we saw, the one-stop solution to clear the cache in Laravel is the command `php artisan optimize:clear`, which clears the following caches:

- **The config cache.**
- **The bootstrap cache.**
- **The auto-discovered events cache.**
- **The application cache.**
- **The routes cache.**
- **The views cache.**

## Clear Laravel's application cache

To clear Laravel's application cache, run `php artisan cache:clear`. Whether you are using files, Redis, or memcached, it will be wiped clean.

You can also remove one particular value from the cache using `php artisan cache:forget <key> [store]`. That's handy when you're trying to fix something without disrupting everything else.

## Clear Laravel's config cache

To clear Laravel's config cache, run `php artisan config:clear`. The *bootstrap/cache/config.php* file will be deleted, and your fresh config settings will take over.

## Clear Laravel's auto-discovered events cache

To clear Laravel's auto-discovered events cache, run `php artisan event:clear` will delete the *bootstrap/cache/events.php* file. Now Laravel can discover all your shiny new listeners.

Learn more about [Laravel's automatic event discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/events#event-discovery).

## Clear Laravel's routes cache

To clear Laravel's routes caches, run `php artisan route:clear`. Laravel will remove *bootstrap/cache/routes-v7.php*. Your new routes are now live and ready to be explored.

## Clear Laravel's scheduled tasks cache

To clear Laravel's scheduled tasks cache, run `php artisan schedule:clear-cache` to wipe the slate clean.

Here's a word of caution: Unless you have good reasons, it's not advised to run this command in a production environment. Want to know why? Check out Laravel's guide on [preventing task overlaps](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/scheduling#preventing-task-overlaps).

## Clear Laravel's views cache

To clear Laravel's views cache, run `php artisan view:clear`. The framework will empty the content of *storage/views*.

## Bonus: turn off Laravel's application cache

To turn off Laravel's application cache, change the `CACHE_DRIVER` environment variable to `null`.

```
CACHE_DRIVER=null
```

This action doesn't clear the cache but prevents anything from being cached or being retrieved from it.
