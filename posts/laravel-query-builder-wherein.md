## Introduction to Laravel's whereIn() method in the query builder

When you're diving into [Laravel's query builder](https://laravel.com/docs/queries), one of the handy tools in your arsenal is the `whereIn()` method.

It's a straightforward yet powerful way to filter your database queries. 

Think of it like a tool helping you pick exactly what you need from a list of items in your database.

## How whereIn() works

Imagine you have a list of user IDs, and you need to fetch users that match these IDs from your database.

That's where Laravel's query builder `whereIn()` method comes into play.

It allows you to specify a column, like `user_id`, and a set of values. The framework then fetches rows where the column's value is in the provided set.

## Using whereIn() in your code

Here's a quick example:

```php
$users = User::whereIn('id', [1, 2, 3])->get();
```

In this snippet, the `whereIn()` method is fetching users whose `id` is either 1, 2, or 3.

Without `whereIn()`, you whould have to do something like this:

```php
$users = User::where('id', 1)
	->orWhere('id', 2)
	->orWhere('id', 3)
	->get();
```

## When not to use whereIn()

While `whereIn()` is handy, it's important to use it wisely.

If you have a massive array of items you're filtering by, this can slow down your query. So, always try to limit the size of the array you pass to `whereIn()`.

Instead, I would try to find the common denominator between all those items and use that to run my queries faster.
