## PHP is dead. Or is it?

**In 2022, PHP is the most used server-side scripting language with more than 77% market share overall, according to [W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language).**

Whenever you hear someone telling you "PHP is dead", ignore them and look at the data.

## PHP versions market share in 2022

**The PHP version having the most market share in 2022 is PHP 7.**

WordPress requires at least PHP 7.4 to be installed. Imagine how PHP 8 usage will skyrocket once WordPress increments its minimum requirements.

It's also funny to see some ancient websites still up and running thanks to PHP 4. 😅

| PHP Version | Usage in October 2022 |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| 7           | 71.1%                 |
| 5           | 23.0%                 |
| 8           | 5.7%                  |
| 4           | 0.2%                  |

## Popular websites using PHP

A language is viable if it can be ran at scale by big teams.

What's better than a list of the most popular websites actually using at a **huge** scale?

- Facebook. They actually started with PHP, but later created a version of PHP (called "Hack") that better suits their needs.

**The CMS having the most market share in 2022 is WordPress.**

Demand for content management systems (CMS) is exploding. Businesses always need to reach new customers through SEO, and a good CMS is mandatory for that. This trend will likely never fade.

| CMS            | Market share in October 2022 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| WordPress      | 64.3%                        |

## WordPress marketshare in 2022

WordPress has more than 64% market share across the web.

I'm not surprised that WordPress is so popular. It's an always-evolving CMS, there are plenty of great WordPress hosts, and it has a lot of excellent themes and plugins to help you reach your goals.

Also, if you ever want to switch away from WordPress, most alternatives offer tools to import every post you already wrote. That means WordPress is a safe choice to begin with.

## WordPress versions market share in 2022

**The WordPress version having the most market share in 2022 is version 6.**

Version 6 of WordPress is a significant update that includes a new default theme and a new block-based editor. This new editor is a major change to how WordPress works and allows for more flexibility and creativity when creating new content.

This alone probably drives people to update to the latest major version and, therefore, the latest PHP version.

| WordPress Version | Usage in October 2022 |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 6                 | 57.7%                 |
| 5                 | 35.4%                 |
| 4                 | 6.5%                  |
| 3                 | 0.4%                  |
| 2                 | <0.1%                 |
