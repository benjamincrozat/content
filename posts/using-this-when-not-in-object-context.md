## Introduction

To fix *"Using $this when not in object context"*, you can make the static method that is calling `$this` non-static.

No matter if you're using CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, Yii, or anything else, **`$this` is a variable that refers to the current object**. Therefore, it's natural to not being allowed to call it from a [static method](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php#language.oop5.static.methods).

## How to fix "Using $this when not in object context", by example

Take this code and try to run it. You will see *"Using $this when not in object context"* again.

```php
class Foo {
    public static function bar() {
        // This is bad because we are in a static method.
        $this->baz();
    }
    
    public function baz() {
    }
}

Foo::bar();
```

As you can see, we are trying to call `baz()`, which is a non-static method, from a static method.

As mentioned above, we need to:
1. Remove the `static` keyword from `bar()`'s declaration;
2. Create an instance of `Foo` and call `bar()` from there.

```php
class Foo {
    public function bar() {
        $this->baz();
    }
    
    public function baz() {
    }
}

$foo = new Foo;
$foo->bar();
```

You could also make the baz method static depending on your initial intention:

```php
class Foo {
    public static function bar() {
        static::baz();
    }
    
    public static function baz() {
    }
}
```
