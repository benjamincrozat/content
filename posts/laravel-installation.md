## Introduction to installing Laravel on macOS

So, you finally decided to give Laravel a try.

But how do you even get started? Well, first, you must have a working PHP environment (see how to [install PHP on macOS](https://benjamincrozat.com/install-php-mac-laravel-valet)). Then, you must create a new Laravel project using the official Laravel installer or Composer (the package manager every PHP developer uses to manage dependencies).

Feels overwhelming? Don't worry. In this article, I'll show you exactly how to do that.

## How to install Laravel on macOS

### Using Composer

To install Laravel on macOS, Linux, or WSL, you can create a new project using Composer like so (given you already have a [working PHP environment](https://benjamincrozat.com/install-php-mac-laravel-valet)):

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

Then, you can just `cd` into your project and start the development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Finally, open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

But installing Laravel using Composer is limited and I will show you a better way.

### Using the official Laravel installer

Laravel offers a convenient installer that you can add to Composer's global packages using the following command:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Then, you can create a new project:

```bash
laravel new example-app
```

**If this command doesn't work, make sure you followed [my guide](https://benjamincrozat.com/install-php-mac-laravel-valet) correctly.**

The Laravel installer even offers options to create a new initialized Git repository with a first commit without having to go through the various prompts:

```bash
laravel new example-app --git
```

Or even use Pest as a default test runner:

```Bash
laravel new example-app --pest
```

And you can combine these:

```bash
laravel new example-app --git --pest
```

There are a ton of options and you can see them all by running `laravel new --help`:
