## Laravel Pulse in a nutshell

If you never heard about it, [Laravel Pulse](https://pulse.laravel.com) is a free and open source package for the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com) that helps developers monitor various aspects of their web applications in real-time. You can learn more about it here: [Laravel Pulse: monitor your apps for free](/laravel-pulse)

Laravel Pulse also allows developers to create what's called a "custom card," which will help populate the dashboard with useful data for your application. Let's talk about the best ones I've found in alphabetical order.

## The best custom cards for Laravel Pulse

### laravel-pulse-schedule, which lists all your scheduled tasks

[hosmelq/laravel-pulse-schedule](https://github.com/hosmelq/laravel-pulse-schedule), made by Hosmel Quintana, is a card that will list all your scheduled tasks as well as the next time they will run.

### ohdear-pulse, for uptime, cron tasks (aka scheduled tasks), and broken links monitoring

[ohdearapp/ohdear-pulse](https://github.com/ohdearapp/ohdear-pulse) was made by the great folks at Spatie. This card plugs itself into their awesome service, [Oh Dear](/recommends/oh-dear) (that I actually use for this blog), which provides valuable insights about uptime, cron tasks (aka scheduled tasks), and broken links. We all know how crucial these metrics are on a business-critical application.

### pulse-database, for real-time insights about your databases

[maantje/pulse-database](https://github.com/maantje/pulse-database), made by Jamie Schouten, is a card that will give you real-time insights about your databases such as the active threads, the current amount of connections, and more!

### pulse-outdated, to keep an eye on outdated Composer dependencies

[aaronfrancis/pulse-outdated](https://github.com/aaronfrancis/pulse-outdated), made by Aaron D. Francis, is a card that will help you keep an eye on outdated Composer dependencies. It's a great way to prevent potential security issues by making sure you're always using the latest versions of your dependencies.

### pulse-php-fpm, to monitor your PHP-FPM processes

[maantje/pulse-php-fpm](https://github.com/maantje/pulse-php-fpm), made by Jamie Schouten, is a card that will monitor your PHP-FPM processes. It's a great way to make sure your PHP-FPM configuration is optimal to serve all your traffic.

### vulnerable, to track vulnerable Composer dependencies

[hungthai1401/vulnerable](https://github.com/hungthai1401/vulnerable), made by Thai Nguyen Hung, is a card that will track vulnerable Composer dependencies and entice you to update them.

### 404-monitor, to track 404 not found errors and pinpoint dead links

[geowrgetudor/404-monitor](https://github.com/geowrgetudor/404-monitor), made by George Tudor, is a card that will track dead links on your website. It's a great way to make sure your users don't repeatedly end up on non-existing page ever again.
